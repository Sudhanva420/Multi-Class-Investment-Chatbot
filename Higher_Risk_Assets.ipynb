            "Certainly, diversifying your portfolio with high-risk assets can provide opportunities for significant returns alongside heightened risks. Here's a detailed overview of your requested options, along with insights from recent financial articles:\n",
            "\n",
            "### Option 1: Cryptocurrency\n",
            "Cryptocurrencies represent a highly volatile investment opportunity. While this sector can offer substantial gains during a bullish market, the extreme volatility means potential for large losses. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as the leaders but investing in lesser-known coins could increase the risk as well as the potential reward.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Option 2: Options Trading\n",
            "Options are financial derivatives that provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price within a specific time frame. Options trading can lead to significant gains, especially for short-term strategies like day trading or swing trading. However, they require a good understanding of market trends and the factors influencing prices to manage the inherent risks effectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Option 3: Leveraged ETFs\n",
            "Leveraged Exchange-Traded Funds (LETFs) use financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. Articles highlight that LETFs can provide returns of a specific multiple (e.g., 2:1, 3:1) of the daily performance of the asset they track, such as the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ. While they offer higher potential returns, they also increase the potential for significant losses, particularly in volatile markets. Gordon Scott, a technical analyst, and other experts stress the importance of understanding that the performance of these funds can be unpredictable and may not always align with long-term trends due to their reset mechanism and compounding effects.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the information and expert insights, the best option would depend on your individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and the level of active management you wish to engage in:\n",
            "- **Cryptocurrencies** may suit you if you are looking for extremely high-risk and potentially high-reward investments and are comfortable with the possibility of enduring significant volatility.\n",
            "- **Options trading** is appropriate if you have more experience in financial markets and prefer scenarios where strategic decisions can be frequently adjusted.\n",
            "- **Leveraged ETFs** could be ideal if you seek amplified returns from market movements and are comfortable with the idea that losses can also be magnified. Leveraged ETFs might also appeal if you wish to avoid the complexity of managing individual options positions.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is crucial to further educate yourself about each of these options and possibly consult a financial advisor to tailor investments that complement your overall financial objectives and risk appetite.\n"

If you are looking for a low-risk asset with predictable returns, treasury bonds could be a suitable choice.\n",

It also offers moderate liquidity, allowing you to easily buy and sell gold when needed. However, gold prices can be volatile in the short term, so it may not be suitable for those seeking stable returns.\n",

It tends to have higher volatility compared to gold, which can present both opportunities and risks for investors. If you are comfortable with fluctuating prices and seek exposure to industrial demand dynamics, silver could be an interesting addition to your portfolio.\n",

Each asset class brings different characteristics to the table, allowing you to spread your risk and capture opportunities across various market conditions. It is essential to evaluate your risk tolerance and investment goals before deciding on the best mix of assets for your portfolio.\n"

Leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) try to deliver a greater return.\\n\\n As with other ETFs, the investor can choose an ETF that is based on the S&P 500 Index or the Nasdaq 100, or one of many that tracks a specific sector or industry group.\\n\\n Like stocks, shares of ETFs are traded on a public exchange. Like mutual funds, ETFs allow individual investors to benefit from the diversification and economies of scale that come from joining a large pool of money contributed by many investors.\\n\\n Most ETFs are passive investments. They invest strictly in the stocks, bonds, or other assets that are listed in a particular index such as the S&P 500, buying and selling only when the index is revised.\\n\\n The first leveraged ETFs were introduced in the summer of 2006, after being reviewed for about six years by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\n\\n Like other ETFs, leveraged ETFs often mirror an index fund, and the fund\\'s capital, in addition to investor equity, provides a higher level of investment exposure. Typically, a leveraged ETF will maintain a $2 exposure or $3 exposure to the index for every $1 of investor capital.\\n\\n The fund\\'s goal is to have future appreciation of the investments made with the borrowed capital to exceed the cost of the capital itself.\\n\\n Long before ETFs were introduced, the first investment funds that were listed on stock exchanges were called closed-end funds, meaning that the number of shares issued was fixed. Their pricing was set by supply and demand, and often deviated from the value of the assets in the fund, or net asset value (NAV). This confused and deterred many would-be investors.\\n\\n ETFs solved this problem by allowing management to create and redeem shares as needed. This made the fund open-ended rather than closed-ended and created an arbitrage opportunity for management that helps keep share prices in line with the underlying NAV.\\n\\n As a result, even ETFs with very limited trading volume have share prices that are almost identical to their NAVs.\\n\\n It\\'s important to know that ETFs are almost always fully invested; the constant creation and redemption of shares can increase transaction costs because the fund must resize its investment portfolio. These transaction costs are borne by all investors in the fund.\\n\\nWhile all ETFs have expenses, they are generally very low compared to those for actively managed mutual funds. On the other hand, the expenses for most index mutual funds have been greatly reduced to compete with those of index ETFs. Check the \"expense ratio\" of any fund you\\'re considering.\\n Leveraged ETFs respond to share creation and redemption by increasing or reducing their exposure to the underlying index using derivatives. The derivatives most commonly used are index futures, equity swaps, and index options.\\n\\n The typical holdings of a leveraged index fund include a large amount of cash invested in short-term securities and a smaller but highly volatile portfolio of derivatives. The cash is used to meet any financial obligations that arise from losses on the derivatives.\\n\\n There are also inverse-leveraged ETFs that use the same derivatives to attain short exposure to the underlying ETF or index. These funds profit when the index declines and take losses when the index rises.\\n\\n Maintaining a constant leverage ratio, typically two or three times the amount, is complex. Fluctuations in the price of the underlying index change the value of the leveraged fund\\'s assets, and this requires the fund to change the total amount of index exposure.\\n\\n As an example, say a fund has $100 million of assets and $200 million of index exposure. The index rises 1% on the first day of trading, giving the firm $2 million in profits. (Assume no expenses in this example.) The fund now has $102 million of assets and must increase (in this case, double) its index exposure to $204 million.\\n\\n Maintaining a constant leverage ratio allows the fund to immediately reinvest trading gains. This constant adjustment, called rebalancing, is how the fund is able to provide double the exposure to the index at any point in time, even if the index has recently gained 50% or lost 50%. Without rebalancing, the fund\\'s leverage ratio would change every day, and the fund\\'s returns (as compared to the underlying index) would be unpredictable.\\n\\n In declining markets, rebalancing a leveraged fund with long exposure can be problematic. Reducing the index exposure allows the fund to survive a downturn and limits future losses, but also locks in trading losses and leaves the fund with a smaller asset base.\\n\\n For instance, say the index loses 1% every day for four days in a row and then gains +4.1% on the fifth day, which allows it to recover all of its losses. How would a two-times leveraged ETF based on this index perform during this same period?\\n\\n By the end of the week, our index had returned to its starting point, but our leveraged ETF was still down slightly (0.2%). This is not a rounding error. It\\'s a result of the proportionally smaller asset base in the leveraged fund, which requires a larger return, 8.42% to be exact, to return to its original level.\\n\\n This effect is small in this example but can be significant over longer periods of time in very volatile markets. The larger the percentage drops are, the larger the differences will be.\\n\\n Simulating daily rebalancing is mathematically simple. All that needs to be done is to double the daily index return. What is considerably more complex is estimating the impact of fees on the daily returns of the portfolio.\\n\\n Suppose an investor analyzes monthly returns of the S&P 500 over the past three years and finds that the average monthly return is 0.9%, and the standard deviation of those returns is 2%.\\n\\n Assuming that future returns conform to recent historical averages, the two-times leveraged ETF based upon this index will be expected to return twice the expected return with twice the expected volatility (i.e., 1.8% monthly return with a 4% standard deviation). Most of this gain would come in the form of capital gains rather than dividends.\\n\\n The management expense is the fee levied by the company that offers the fund. This fee is detailed in the prospectus and can be more than 1% of the fund\\'s assets. These fees cover both marketing and fund administration costs.\\n\\n All derivatives have an interest rate built into their pricing. This rate, known as the risk-free rate, is very close to the short-term rate on U.S. government securities. Buying and selling these derivatives also results in transaction expenses.\\n\\n Interest and transaction expenses can be hard to identify and calculate because they are not individual line items but a gradual reduction of fund profitability. One approach that works well is to compare a leveraged ETF\\'s performance against its underlying index for several months and examine the differences between expected and actual returns.\\n\\n Suppose a two-times leveraged small-cap ETF has assets of $500 million, and the appropriate index is trading for $50. The fund purchases derivatives to simulate $1 billion of exposure to the appropriate small-cap index, or 20 million shares, using a combination of index futures, index options, and equity swaps.\\n\\n The fund maintains a large cash position to offset potential declines in the index futures and equity swaps. This cash is invested in short-term securities and helps offset the interest costs associated with these derivatives.\\n\\n Every day, the fund rebalances its index exposure based upon fluctuations in the price of the index and on share creation and redemption obligations. During the year, this fund generates $33 million of expenses, as detailed below.\\n\\n In one year, the index increases 10%, to $55, and the 20 million shares are now worth $1.1 billion. The fund has generated capital gains and dividends of $100 million and incurred $33 million in total expenses.\\n\\n After all the expenses are backed out, the resultant gain, $67 million, represents a 13.4% gain for the investors in the fund.\\n\\n On the other hand, if the index had declined 10%, to $45, the result would be a very different story. Investors would have lost $133 million, or 25% of their invested capital. The fund would also sell some of these depreciated securities to reduce index exposure to $734 million, or twice the amount of investor equity (now $367 million).\\n\\n This example does not take into account daily rebalancing. Long sequences of good or bad daily returns can have a noticeable impact on the fund\\'s shareholdings and performance.\\n\\nThe ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF is among the more actively traded leveraged funds. Trading under the ticker SQQQ, the fund is designed to move three times the daily changes in the Nasdaq 100 Index.\\nA 2x leveraged ETF is designed to move twice as much as the amount the underlying asset or sector moves. A 3x leveraged ETF is created to move three times as much as the underlying asset or sector.\\nThere are several reasons that triple-leveraged CDs are not usually considered prudent long-term investments. The biggest of those reasons is the drag from market volatility and the leverage costs over time.\\n Leveraged ETFs, like most ETFs, are simple to buy and sell, but there is far greater complexity behind the scenes. Fund management is constantly buying and selling derivatives to maintain a target index exposure. This results in interest and transaction expenses and significant fluctuations in index exposure due to daily rebalancing.\\n\\n Because of these factors, it is impossible for any of these funds to provide twice the return of the index for long periods of time. The best way to develop realistic performance expectations for these products is to study the ETF\\'s past daily returns as compared to those of the underlying index.\\n\\n For investors already familiar with leveraged investing, leveraged ETFs may have little to offer. These investors will probably be more comfortable managing their own portfolios, and directly controlling their index exposure and leverage ratio.\\n\\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Mutual Fund vs ETF: What’s the Difference?\"\\nDavies, Shaun William. \"Speculation Sentiment.\"\\xa0Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis,\\xa0vol. 57, no. 7, November 2022, pp. 2494.\\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Fund Services Agreement.”\\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"The Lowdown on Leveraged and Inverse Exchange-Traded Products.\"\\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Updated Investor Bulletin: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).\"\\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Updated Investor Bulletin: Leveraged and Inverse ETFs.\"\\nProShares. \"UltraPro Short QQQ.\"\\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"The Lowdown on Leveraged and Inverse Exchange-Traded Products.\"'), ('Leveraged ETFs Are Not Worth the Trouble', 'Leveraged exchange traded fund ETFs are apparently selling well. Morningstar estimates that, in the US alone, they saw net inflows of around $13 million in the 12 months to the end of January 2025.\\xa0\\nThese products are now firmly established. For example, the world’s largest leveraged ETF, ProShares UltraPro QQQ, has just marked its 15th anniversary. (1) But are they worth investing in?\\nFirst, an explainer is in order. Leveraged ETFs are far more complicated than I suspect many people trading them on sites like eToro actually realise.\\xa0\\nIn simple terms, leveraged ETFs are designed to amplify the daily returns of an underlying index or asset, using derivatives like swaps and futures. There are bull (or long) versions, which aim to deliver 2x or 3x the daily return of an index, and bear (inverse) versions, which aim to provide -1x, -2x, or -3x the daily return, allowing investors to profit when markets fall.\\nAs well as funds offering leveraged exposure to markets like the FTSE 100 or S&P 500, there are also funds that focus on specific sectors or commodities, or even individual stocks.\\xa0\\nCrucially, leveraged ETFs are generally designed for short-term trading, often a single day to a few weeks at most.\\nMorningstar’s chief ratings officer Jeffrey Ptak recently analysed the performance that leveraged ETFs have delivered for investors. (2) Ptak compiled the daily flows and net assets of leveraged stock and bond ETFs’ over the year-long period ending 7th February 2025. Using that data, he estimated that the return of the average dollar invested in them was around 23%.\\nHe then looked at how that compared with simply buying and holding the leveraged ETFs’ reference assets. So, for example, how would an investor have fared if they had bought a simple, unleveraged S&P 500 ETF, instead of a 2-times leveraged S&P 500 ETF? He found that, over the period, investing in the unleveraged ETFs or individual stocks would have returned around 18%, or 5% less than the return achieved through leveraging.\\nSo is this a win for leveraged ETFs? Unfortunately not. For a start, investors in leveraged ETFs endured far greater volatility. But, more importantly, as Ptak points out, investing in these products is “largely a crap shoot”.\\xa0\\n“Of the 95 daily leveraged long ETFs I examined,” he writes, “nearly half had a dollar-weighted return that fell shy of the return of the index or stock to which they were tied. This means investors appear to have accrued little benefit from the leverage they paid extra to get in the first place.\\nWhat’s more, according to Ptak, fees and charges for leveraged ETFs are many times higher than they are for conventional ETFs.\\nInvestors, he concludes, should avoid trading ‘daily’ leveraged stock and bond ETFs altogether. “As the name suggests,” he writes, “they’re meant to be held for a single day, a time horizon far too short to allow for anything other than speculation.\\xa0\\n“Even over a one-day interval, these ETFs appeared not to fully capture the leveraged return of the indexes and stocks they reference, and that got even worse as the holding period got longer. This seems to call their utility as short-term trading vehicles into question, too — not that it’s advisable to use them that way to begin with.”\\nOf course, it’s well documented that individual investors struggle to compete with professional investors and big institutions. But do the pros fare any better with leveraged ETFs than individuals? The evidence suggests they don’t.\\nA 2021 study showed that the more U.S. institutions made of leveraged ETFs, the worse they performed. (3) The authors concluded: “Institutions in aggregate do not benefit from exposure to l (them). Rather, these instruments appear to be used by institutions prone to poor market timing.”\\nSo what are the lessons for investors? The main one is that, as Jeffrey Ptak says, most investors should avoid leveraged ETFs altogether.\\xa0\\nThey are extremely risky, especially if you hold them for more than a day. They’re also complex, which adds to the risk you take if you don’t fully understand them.\\nLeveraged single-name ETFs in particular are the most extreme example of the fund management industry’s headlong rush into increasingly, esoteric and largely pointless, active ETFs. (4)\\nAs Robin Wigglesworth wrote about them in the FT: “It’s tempting to call this phenomenon financial masturbation, but self-pleasure is cost-free and has rarely harmed anyone. Leveraged single-name ETFs incinerate investor money, make markets more volatile and are solely created to generate fees for the sponsor.” (5) That’s hardly a ringing endorsement.\\nThis article is produced by us for Financial Advisers who may choose to share it with their clients.

Inverse and leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are very risky investments that can amplify returns but can compound losses if the markets go against you.\\nInverse and leveraged ETFs are niche trading vehicles for short-term trading. They have daily return objectives and, in general, are not for buy-and-hold investors.\\nMany leveraged, inverse, and leveraged inverse vehicles are not ETFs but rather are exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that often are lumped together with ETFs. ETNs are debt instruments and subject to counterparty risk—the possibility that the other party in an investment or transaction may default on the obligation.\\nFirst off, knowing how traditional exchange-traded funds work helps to understand how leveraged and inverse ETFs function. A traditional passive ETF seeks to track the price of an index, such as the S&P 500. The price of the ETF goes up and down at roughly the same pace as the index by owning the same securities as the index. If the Nasdaq 100 goes up 1%, for example, an ETF tracking that index, such as the Invesco QQQ (QQQ), rises by the same percentage.\\nA leveraged ETF amplifies those gains or losses. These types of ETFs may attempt to create returns that are two, three, or even 10 times the return of an underlying index. Fund companies issuing the leveraged ETF won’t own the underlying securities of the index, but will often use options contracts to amplify the return.\\nAn inverse ETF, sometimes called a short ETF, seeks to profit when the price of a benchmark falls. These ETFs often use futures contracts, swaps, or other derivatives to try to meet the daily return objectives. These can offer short-term portfolio hedges against declines, and are easier to use than creating a margin account for short selling.\\nA leveraged inverse ETF combines these two strategies into one ETF, seeking to amplify the return when an index drops. These funds are highly speculative.\\nThere are leveraged ETFs and inverse ETFs in most sectors, including:\\nThese ETFs are best used as short-term trading vehicles, not long-term buy-and-hold positions. Although these ETFs have stated objectives, there can be a significant difference between the expected return and actual performance over the long term.\\nSlippage is the industry term for the transaction costs and logistical inefficiencies that drag down the performance of a fund or strategy relative to its benchmark. For leveraged and inverse ETFs and ETNs, here are two of the big culprits:\\nEither way, using derivatives in an ETF will raise the transaction frequency, and thus the cost to operate.\\nLeveraged ETFs seek to magnify the daily return of an index, whether it’s by two, three, or 10 times (or the inverse). In dollar terms, that means that for each dollar invested the goal is to return $2, $3, or $10 compared to the daily performance of the index.\\nAt the end of each trading day, the most inverse and leveraged ETFs “reset” to that day’s settlement price, and the next day, the ETF seeks a return that corresponds to its leveraged and/or inverse objective.\\nIf a fund is held beyond a day, the return is a compound of daily leveraged returns based on how long the investor owns the fund.\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses this example to show how a two-times leveraged fund works on a down day and then on an up day:\\n“Most leveraged and inverse ETFs reset each day, which means they are designed to achieve their stated objective on a daily basis. With the effects of compounding, over longer time frames the results can differ significantly from their objective.” —FINRA guidance on non-traditional ETFs\\nEven when the ETF rebounds on the second day, the return is lower than the index because the fund has to recoup its gains from a lower level. The longer an investor holds the fund, the more their leveraged returns deviate from the index’s nominal performance. If you hold it for a day, a leveraged ETF will track the index accordingly. But if you hold it for a week, a month, or year, your return profile can deviate greatly from the weekly, monthly, or annual return of the underlying benchmark due to the “daily reset” nature of these ETFs.\\nLeveraged and inverse products are designed for trading, not investing. These products might be appropriate for someone who:\\nIf you can’t tolerate losing a lot of money in a short time or don’t understand how these funds operate, they are not for you.\\nAs with any investment, it’s important to know what you own. That involves reading the prospectus to understand how it seeks to achieve its objective and what the risks are. With leveraged and inverse products, the risks are substantial.\\nFurther, these funds are typically much more expensive to hold than other ETFs, and they can be less tax efficient because the daily calculation and reset may cause short-term capital gains, meaning they are taxed at the same level as ordinary income.\\nThis article is intended for educational purposes only and not as an endorsement of a particular financial strategy, company, or fund.

He's going to talk about leverage and inverse funds. These are funds that created a few headlines recently about whether they are good investments at all. We're going to ask today, is there any use for these funds and how can you use them in a smart way, if you are going to use them?\\nThanks for joining me, Paul.\\nPaul Justice: Thanks for having me.\\nStipp: So, you folks talked about these funds at length recently, talked about why you have to use them carefully and why they perform in ways that people don't expect.\\nBefore we talk about how you might use these in a smart way, can we talk about these investments don't perform the way people expect them to perform and why people get into somewhat of a trap with them because of the way that they are using them?\\nJustice: Sure. Well first, you can look at the data: Any leveraged ETF that's been around since Jan. 1 of 2008 or before has a loss, and there were 23 up funds and 23 down (inverse) funds. So, for all those to have a loss, there has got to be some sort of issue going on if indexes are going to move in any direction. That issue is a volatility drag: Whenever there is volatility in the market, which we had heightened volatility for a long period of time, it will cause both double-long and double-short funds, potentially, to lose money, no matter which way the index goes.\\nSo, that's an issue that people need to aware of. It's an expectation error, where they see this phrase of two times or ... three times long or short, and they expect that, no matter when they purchase that fund, when they sell it, if it's one day or one year later, they have this mentality, they expect to get that multiplier. That's not the case at all. You look in that fund's\\xa0prospectus, and\\xa0it defines what kind of timeframe you should get that exposure.\\nStipp: So, the timeframe is important because these funds do say that they are going to do an inverse, they do say that they are going to give double exposure. Do they actually deliver it over any time period then?\\nJustice: They generally perform extremely well over the stated timeframe, which is generally one day for almost all funds, and then some of the commodity funds and others do have a month-long period. But for the most part, day-in and day-out for that one-day period, they track extremely well.\\nStipp: So, one day investing is something that's beyond the realm, I think, of a lot of people out there. They don't think about, where I'm going to put my money today, and I think especially Morningstar readers don't necessarily think that way.\\nIs there a way to use these funds over a longer period of time, if you thought that you needed to have or wanted to have one of these funds, where you can adjust for this one day time period?\\nJustice: Certainly. They wouldn't be around if there wasn't a legitimate use for them. We do caution strongly against some individual investors, who don't have the time to trade in their account every single day to use these funds. These are very hands-on approach to fund management.\\nBut if you are an institution, and you are really looking to get some exposure say, you have transition management or people sold out your funds, but you want to maintain market exposure, so you're going to put that cash to work for that one-day period, leverage funds make a lot of sense in that case, or if you are a very speculative short-term trader, and you've got some sort of move that you expect to happen in a couple of days, these are an effective way to get exposure.\\nThe reason being, first, they are extremely liquid, they are broadly traded, they cover lots of sectors, lots of broad indices. So, you can get in and out these positions very easily without really having a disruptive cost.\\nSecond, oftentimes, the leveraged ETF is going to give you exposure to things that there may or may not be substitutes, like futures markets, available in some of these sub-sectors where ETF have proliferated. So, it gives an institution this opportunity to get targeted exposure in an area where a\\xa0futures market or spot market will be cost prohibitive.\\nI think the third way is that, leveraged ETF are generally going to give the purchasers, the\\xa0individuals, the advisors, they are going to give you an extremely low institutional-type interest rate on the borrowings. Whenever you have a leveraged fund, you ... basically have to borrow from somebody else to get two times the exposure.\\nIf you were to do that in a margin account, that can be an extremely high interest rate; 7%-8% wouldn't be uncommon in a brokerage account. Whereas if you look at swap interest rates in the market, I mean they are extremely low especially over a short period of time. It could be almost negligible over the course of the year right now. So, I think that's one good use.\\nI would say, if somebody chooses to use these funds, they really want to get that exposure, the key is, that they do have to look at the funds and rebalance them every day because after one day, if you've got a two times long fund, and you're actually right,\\xa0that index goes up 1% or 2%, you're actually going to have a much large position in that fund, and your second day exposure\\xa0is also going to get two times return. So, it could magnify very quickly.\\nSo, after it goes up, you should be taking some money off the table on that position, or conversely if it was going down, you'd have to add money to that position. So, it can be quite tax inefficient, if you are going to be going through that approach.\\nStipp: So, as with any investment, you really need to know what these funds are doing. They are performing as they are saying they are going to perform. They could have some very specific uses, particularly as you said, for some institutional investors, but certainly if you are looking at one of these funds, make sure you know how it operates, make sure you know how you are going to use it, and set the right expectations.\\nJustice: Exactly. People like to envision that they are sophisticated, educated investors, but give yourself realistic assessment of not only your intellectual capabilities, but your time commitment, how willing you are to watch that and trade that thing very frequently--otherwise you can get whip-side very quickly.\\nStipp: All right Paul, well it sounds like certainly an investment that you should handle with care, you should dig into before you consider. Thanks for the tips and for joining me today.\\nJustice: My pleasure. Thank you.\\nStipp: For Morningstar, I am Jason Stipp. Thanks for watching.\\nJason Stipp: I am Jason Stipp for Morningstar.\\nIt's\\xa0ETF Investing Week\\xa0on Morningstar.com, and today we are answering your ETF questions.\\nI'm talking with Paul Justice; he is director of North American research for ETFs. He's going to talk about leverage and inverse funds. These are funds that created a few headlines recently about whether they are good investments at all. We're going to ask today, is there any use for these funds and how can you use them in a smart way, if you are going to use them?\\nThanks for joining me, Paul.\\nPaul Justice: Thanks for having me.\\nStipp: So, you folks talked about these funds at length recently, talked about why you have to use them carefully and why they perform in ways that people don't expect.\\nBefore we talk about how you might use these in a smart way, can we talk about these investments don't perform the way people expect them to perform and why people get into somewhat of a trap with them because of the way that they are using them?\\nJustice: Sure. Well first, you can look at the data: Any leveraged ETF that's been around since Jan. 1 of 2008 or before has a loss, and there were 23 up funds and 23 down (inverse) funds. So, for all those to have a loss, there has got to be some sort of issue going on if indexes are going to move in any direction. That issue is a volatility drag: Whenever there is volatility in the market, which we had heightened volatility for a long period of time, it will cause both double-long and double-short funds, potentially, to lose money, no matter which way the index goes.\\nSo, that's an issue that people need to aware of. It's an expectation error, where they see this phrase of two times or ... three times long or short, and they expect that, no matter when they purchase that fund, when they sell it, if it's one day or one year later, they have this mentality, they expect to get that multiplier. That's not the case at all. You look in that fund's\\xa0prospectus, and\\xa0it defines what kind of timeframe you should get that exposure.\\nStipp: So, the timeframe is important because these funds do say that they are going to do an inverse, they do say that they are going to give double exposure. Do they actually deliver it over any time period then?\\nJustice: They generally perform extremely well over the stated timeframe, which is generally one day for almost all funds, and then some of the commodity funds and others do have a month-long period. But for the most part, day-in and day-out for that one-day period, they track extremely well.\\nStipp: So, one day investing is something that's beyond the realm, I think, of a lot of people out there. They don't think about, where I'm going to put my money today, and I think especially Morningstar readers don't necessarily think that way.\\nIs there a way to use these funds over a longer period of time, if you thought that you needed to have or wanted to have one of these funds, where you can adjust for this one day time period?\\nJustice: Certainly. They wouldn't be around if there wasn't a legitimate use for them. We do caution strongly against some individual investors, who don't have the time to trade in their account every single day to use these funds. These are very hands-on approach to fund management.\\nBut if you are an institution, and you are really looking to get some exposure say, you have transition management or people sold out your funds, but you want to maintain market exposure, so you're going to put that cash to work for that one-day period, leverage funds make a lot of sense in that case, or if you are a very speculative short-term trader, and you've got some sort of move that you expect to happen in a couple of days, these are an effective way to get exposure.\\nThe reason being, first, they are extremely liquid, they are broadly traded, they cover lots of sectors, lots of broad indices.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst’s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here\\nQuantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar’s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company’s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar’s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit here\\nThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar’s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar’s conviction in those products’ investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they’re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst’s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here\\nThe Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.\\nFor information on the historical Morningstar Medalist Rating for any managed investment Morningstar covers, please contact your local Morningstar office.\\nFor more detailed information about conflicts of interest, including EU MAR disclosures, please see the “Morningstar Medalist Rating Analyst Conflict of Interest & Other Disclosures for EMEA”here\"), ('The dangers of leveraged ETFs ', '\\nRobin Wigglesworth\\nPublishedAugust 31 2023\\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\\nMost ETFs are big, broad, boring and cheap beta. But there’s now probably close to $200bn in leveraged and inverse ETFs, and their market impact is growing.\\nLeveraged and inverse ETFs use derivatives and margin loans to either deliver extra juice to investors — say, three times the daily return of the underlying index — or the opposite of what the index does. \\n“Good” examples are things like TQQQ, the $20bn triple-leveraged Nasdaq ETF; TMF, a three-times leveraged Treasury bond ETF with $2.5bn in assets, and the $90mn SOXS, which delivers three times the losses of semiconductor shares. There are even single-name leveraged ETFs. It’s basically all gone a bit mad. \\nInterestingly, even the Bank of England’s capital markets division now seems to be taking a closer look at the phenomenon — and the potential market implications. \\nThe central bank’s Bank Underground blog has just published a post by former derivatives trader turned gamekeeper Julian Oakland (who this month seems to have joined ADG as head of risk) that examines the market dynamics around leveraged ETFs. \\nHere is the intro, with Alphaville’s emphasis below: \\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are supposed to be simple and straightforward, and for the most part they are, but one group punches well above its weight when it comes to market impact. In this post, I show that leveraged and inverse (L&I) ETFs generate rebalancing flows that: (1) are always in the same direction of the underlying market move; (2) grow significantly with both increasing and inverse leverage; and (3) must be transacted towards the end of the trading day. These features give rebalancing flows the potential to amplify market moves when markets are at their most vulnerable. L&I ETFs do not currently pose a risk to UK financial stability, but this could change if they grow in popularity.\\nThe post does a good job of unpicking how leveraged and inverse ETFs function, and especially how they are an inherently procyclical force, reinforcing both rallies and sell-offs. \\nAs Oakland points out, they’re not particularly significant in the UK stock market, so worries about their impact there are premature. But as the post caveats, that could change. \\nAnd they ARE a force to be reckoned with in the US market, as the post explains (Alphaville’s emphasis below):\\nOn 13 September 2022, equity markets had their largest sell-off since 2020, with the Nasdaq 100 down 5.2% and the S&P 500 down 4.3%.\\xa0Using ETF fund data from etfdb.com and equity market data from www.cboe.com, I calculated rebalancing flows for all US equity L&I ETFs on this day to be just over US$20 billion of equities sold, representing around 3.8% of the total value of all S&P 500 shares traded (or the equivalent of just over 100,000 E-mini S&P 500 futures — as an old futures and options trader, these numbers made me gulp!).\\xa0\\nGulp indeed.

However, it also carries notable risks, such as complexity and the potential for significant losses.\\nIn this article, we will examine the benefits and risks of options trading which are taught in many option trading classes so that you can see how they fit into your overall trading plan.\\nOptions trading gives traders flexibility, potential for profits, and risk management capabilities. Below are some advantages:\\nIf you opt for options trading, you can have control of many assets by investing a small amount. For instance, instead of purchasing 100 shares of a stock, you could purchase one call option contract that represents these 100 shares at a fraction of the cost.\\nThrough this leverage, profits may be increased if the trade is successful. However, you should remember that leverage can also multiply losses if this trade does not work out well. So it is better to be careful.\\nOptions allow traders to manage risk by hedging against potential losses in their portfolios. For example, purchasing put options on a stock can act as an insurance policy against the decline of its trades, by paying money for the option, limiting their downside risk irrespective of how low the price of the stock may go.\\nThis defensive tactic gives some protection that enables traders to reduce losses in unpredictable market environments.\\nSelling options contracts generates income through premiums, particularly in low-volatility markets. By taking on the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price (strike price), traders collect upfront payments.\\nThis strategy, known as option writing, offers a steady income stream. However, it requires careful risk management to avoid potential losses if the market moves unfavorably.\\nOverall, it provides an opportunity to profit from the passage of time and stable market conditions.\\nThere’s no doubt that options trading can be worthwhile, yet it is related to important risks as well. Here are a few significant dangers involved in options trading.\\nOptions have expiry dates, which means they last just for a period. In case of failure to move in the anticipated direction within that time frame, the option may be worthless on its expiry date. This leads to losing the premium amount paid for it.\\nUnlike stocks, where you can hold onto them indefinitely, options have a limited lifespan, making it crucial to time your trades accurately to avoid losing your investment.\\nVolatility risk in options trading refers to how the price of an option can change due to fluctuations in the underlying asset’s volatility.\\nHigher volatility typically leads to higher option prices, but if volatility decreases, option values may decline, causing losses.\\nEssentially, unexpected changes in market volatility can impact option prices, making it crucial for traders to consider and manage this risk when making trading decisions.\\nWhen you buy options, the most you can lose is the money you paid for them. But if you sell options, especially without owning the underlying asset, your potential losses could be unlimited.\\nThis means that if the market moves against your position, you could lose more money than you initially invested.\\nSo, while buying options limits your risk, selling them without proper protection can expose you to significant financial danger.\\nOptions trading offers chances for higher returns but also comes with risks. By learning about the pros and cons we discussed, you’re better prepared for this type of investing. It’s important to keep learning and managing risks wisely.

This lack of coverage creates opportunities for investors who do deep research.\\nExample: In the early 2000s, Trex (TREX) dominated the composite decking market but received little analyst attention.\\nAs demand for low-maintenance decking surged, Trex grew into a multi-billion-dollar company, which was very rewarding for its early investors.\\nSmall-cap companies often operate in emerging industries or create disruptive products.\\nThey move faster than larger competitors, allowing them to capture market share before established businesses react.\\nFor instance, Upstart (UPST) used artificial intelligence to improve credit underwriting.\\nThe company’s ability to innovate quickly helped it grow revenue rapidly, though macroeconomic challenges later impacted its stock price.\\nLarge companies frequently buy small-cap stocks to expand their product offerings or enter new markets. Investors who buy small-caps with strong acquisition appeal can benefit when a larger company offers to acquire the smaller company at a premium price for the stock.\\nFor example, Salesforce (CRM) acquired Slack (previously $WORK) in 2021 for $27.7 billion, at a premium price to what Slack stock was trading at before the acquisition.\\nSlack had positioned itself as a key player in workplace communication, and its acquisition premium rewarded shareholders who recognized its long-term potential.\\nSmall-cap stocks often trade at lower earnings and revenue multiples than large-cap stocks for several reasons:\\nMany small-cap stocks have low institutional ownership, leading to less buying pressure. As companies grow and attract large investors, their stock prices often rise.\\nFor instance, Cloudflare (NET) had low institutional ownership early on. As hedge funds and mutual funds recognized its growth potential, more capital flowed into the company, which pushed the stock higher.\\nBy understanding the valuation gap between small-caps and large-caps, investors can identify stocks with room to re-rate at a higher multiple as they grow.\\nSmall-cap stocks go through cycles of outperformance and underperformance. Investors who recognize these patterns can adjust their strategies to maximize returns.\\nSmall-cap stocks perform well in certain market conditions, including:\\nExample: From 2009 to 2013, the Russell 2000 Index outperformed the S&P 500 as the economy recovered from the financial crisis.\\nLower interest rates and improving corporate earnings fueled small-cap gains.\\nAdditional Example: After the Fed cut rates in 2020, small-caps had a historic rally, with the Russell 2000 surging over 100% from its pandemic low.\\nSmall-caps are less likely to outperform during tough market conditions:\\nFor example, in 2022, as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively, small-cap stocks lagged large-caps. Investors rotated into more stable, cash-flow-generating businesses, leaving riskier small stocks behind.\\nWhile small-cap stocks can deliver strong returns, they also come with additional risks that investors must consider.\\nSmall-cap stocks often have low trading volume, leading to:\\nFor example, micro-cap biotech stocks often experience extreme volatility, rising or falling 50%+ in a single trading session based on news or earnings reports.\\nSmall businesses tend to be more vulnerable to economic downturns than large corporations. Investors should watch for:\\nFor example, during the 2008 financial crisis, many small banks and retailers collapsed, while large corporations with diversified revenue streams weathered the storm better.\\nMany small-cap stocks rely on a single customer or supplier for a large portion of revenue.\\nLosing that relationship can cause serious financial trouble.\\nFor example, GoPro (GPRO) depended heavily on Best Buy (BBY) and Amazon (AMZN) for distribution, making it vulnerable to shifts in retail demand.\\nAs sales growth slowed and competition increased, the company struggled to diversify revenue, contributing to a steep stock decline.\\nHistorically, small caps have outperformed large caps over long periods.\\nBut, small-caps also carry higher risks. Their volatility, lower liquidity, and sensitivity to macroeconomic trends mean investors need a strategy that accounts for both upside potential and downside protection.\\nUltimately, every investor’s situation is different, from risk tolerance to time horizon and financial goals. It’s up to each person to choose investments that fit their strategy.\\nInvestors should consider small-caps alongside other asset classes to balance risk and return. Small-cap exposure works well when combined with:\\nFor example, an investor who held both small-cap growth stocks and dividend-paying large-caps in the 2010s saw strong returns with lower volatility than an all-small-cap portfolio.\\nSmall-cap investing rewards patience. Many of the best small-cap stocks take years to realize their full potential.\\nInvestors who focus on long-term trends, strong fundamentals, and proven management teams often achieve better results than those trying to trade short-term price swings.\\nFor instance, MercadoLibre (MELI) spent years expanding in Latin America before becoming an e-commerce giant. Investors who stayed patient instead of selling on early volatility saw exponential gains.\\nBy understanding when small-caps perform best, managing risk effectively, and thinking long-term, investors can use small-cap stocks to enhance portfolio returns while minimizing downside exposure.\\nSmall-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks because they have higher growth potential, face less analyst coverage, and often operate in underpenetrated markets. These factors create opportunities for investors to find undervalued companies before they gain widespread attention.\\nSmall-cap stocks underperform during recessions, periods of high inflation, and when interest rates rise, making borrowing more expensive. In these environments, investors often shift capital toward large-cap stocks with stronger balance sheets.\\nSmall-cap stocks carry more risk than large-cap stocks due to lower liquidity, higher volatility, and greater sensitivity to economic conditions. However, investors who manage risk well can still achieve strong long-term returns.\\nInterest rates affect small-cap stocks because rising rates increase borrowing costs and reduce liquidity in the market, making investors more risk-averse. Conversely, falling rates often boost small-cap performance by improving access to capital and encouraging economic growth.\\nThe best time to buy small-cap stocks is early in an economic recovery, after a major market sell-off, or when interest rates peak and start to decline. These conditions often create attractive valuations and strong growth opportunities for small-cap companies.\\nSmall-cap stocks can offer some of the highest potential returns in the market.\\nThe TIKR Terminal offers industry-leading financial data on over 100,000 stocks, so if you’re looking to\\xa0find the best stocks to buy\\xa0for your portfolio, you’ll want to use TIKR!\\nTIKR offers institutional-quality research for investors who think of buying stocks as buying a piece of a business.\\nSign up for free right now!\\nPlease note that the articles on TIKR are not intended to serve as investment or financial advice from TIKR or our content team, nor are they recommendations to buy or sell any stocks.\\xa0 We create our content based on TIKR Terminal’s investment data and analysts’ estimates.

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\\nDavid is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\\n Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a great investment vehicle for small and large investors alike. These popular funds, which are similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks, have become a popular choice among investors looking to broaden the diversity of their portfolios without increasing the time and effort that they have to spend managing and allocating their investments.\\n\\n ETFs represent ownership in a basket of stocks or bonds. The value of an ETF can appreciate if the underlying assets appreciate. In addition, investments that incur cash flow such as interest or dividends may automatically be reinvested into the fund. However, investors need to be aware of some disadvantages before jumping into the world of ETFs.\\n\\n One of the biggest advantages of\\xa0ETFs is that they trade like stocks. An ETF invests in a portfolio of separate companies, typically linked by a common sector or theme. Investors simply buy the ETF to reap the benefits of investing in that larger portfolio all at once.\\n\\n As a result of the stock-like nature of ETFs, investors can buy and sell during market hours, as well as enter advanced orders on the purchase, such as limits and stops. Conversely, a typical mutual fund purchase is made after the market closes, once the net asset value of the fund is calculated.\\n\\n Every time you buy or sell a stock, you might pay a commission. This is also the case when it comes to buying and selling ETFs. Depending on how often you trade an ETF, trading fees can quickly add up and reduce your investment’s performance.\\n\\n No-load mutual funds, on the other hand, are sold without a commission or sales charge—making them relatively advantageous,\\xa0in this regard, vs. ETFs. It is important to be aware of trading fees when comparing an investment in ETFs with a similar investment in a mutual fund.\\n\\nMany online brokers today offer zero-commission trading in stocks and ETFs. Note, however, that you may still pay a hidden commission in the form of payment for order flow (PFOF). This controversial practice routes your orders to a specific counterparty rather than having the market compete for your order at the best price possible.\\n If you are deciding between similar ETFs and mutual funds, be aware of the different fee structures of each, including the trading fees that may be generated inside of actively managed ETFs. And remember, actively trading ETFs, as with stocks, can reduce your investment performance with commissions quickly piling up.\\n\\n Every ETF will also come with an expense ratio. The expense ratio is a measure of what percentage of a fund’s total assets are required to cover various operating expenses each year. While this is not exactly the same as a fee that an investor pays to the fund, it has a similar effect: The higher the expense ratio, the lower the total returns will be for investors.\\n\\n ETFs are known for having very low expense ratios relative to many other investment vehicles, but they are still a factor to consider, especially when comparing otherwise similar ETFs.\\n\\n ETFs, like mutual funds, are often lauded for the diversification that they offer investors. However, it is important to note that just because an ETF contains more than one underlying position doesn’t mean that it is immune to volatility.\\n\\n The potential for large swings will mainly depend on the scope of the fund. An ETF that tracks a broad market index such as the S&P 500 is likely to be less volatile than an ETF that tracks a specific industry or sector, such as an oil services ETF.\\n\\n Therefore, it is vital to be aware of the fund’s focus and what types of investments it includes. As ETFs have continued to grow increasingly specific along with the solidification and popularization of the industry, this has become even more of a concern.\\n\\n In the case of international or global ETFs, the fundamentals of the country that the ETF is following are important, as is the creditworthiness of the currency in that country.\\n\\n Economic and social instability will also play a huge role in determining the success of any ETF that invests in a particular country or region. These factors must be kept in mind when making decisions regarding the viability of an ETF.\\n\\n The rule here is to know what the ETF is tracking and understand the underlying risks associated with it. Don’t be lulled into thinking that all ETFs are the same just because some offer low volatility.\\n\\nTracking error measures how closely an index ETF tracks its benchmark index. Those with larger tracking errors may come with hidden risks.\\n A big factor in trading an ETF,\\xa0a stock,\\xa0or anything else that is traded publicly is liquidity. Liquidity means that when you buy something, there is enough trading interest that you will be able to get out of it relatively quickly without moving the price.\\n\\n If an ETF is thinly traded, there can be problems getting out of the investment, depending on the size of your position relative to the average trading volume. The biggest sign of an illiquid investment is large spreads between the bid and the ask. You need to make sure that an ETF is liquid before buying it, and the best way to do this is to study the spreads and the market movements over a week or month.\\n\\n The rule here is to make sure that the ETF in which you are interested does not have large spreads between the bid and ask prices. Tighter spreads equal greater liquidity, and that corresponds with less risk in entering and exiting your trades.\\n\\n In some cases, an ETF will distribute capital gains to shareholders. This is not always desirable for ETF holders, as shareholders are responsible for paying the capital gains tax. It is usually better if the fund retains the capital gains and invests them, rather than distributing them and creating a tax liability for the investor.\\n\\n Investors will usually want to reinvest those capital gains distributions; to do this, they will need to go back to their brokers to buy more shares, which creates new fees.\\n\\n Because different ETFs treat capital gains distributions in various ways, it can be a challenge for investors to stay apprised of the funds in which they take part. It’s also crucial for an investor to learn about how an ETF treats capital gains distributions before investing in that fund.\\n\\n Say you have $5,000 or $10,000 to invest in an index ETF (such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) but are not sure how to invest: in a lump sum or by dollar-cost averaging. Due to the proliferation of no-fee ETFs, broker commissions are no longer as important a factor as they once were.\\n\\n Lump-sum investing means that you can put your entire investment to work right away. This is great in a rising market, but perhaps not optimal if the market looks like it is peaking or is unusually volatile.\\n\\n With dollar-cost averaging, you spread the $5,000 or $10,000 across equal monthly investments. This strategy works well if the market declines or is choppy, but it does have an opportunity cost if the market rises when only part of your money has been invested. And even small commissions can add up over multiple buy orders unless your brokerage does not charge commissions.\\n\\n When it comes to risk considerations, many investors opt for ETFs because they feel that they are less risky than other modes of investment. We’ve already addressed the issues of volatility above, but it’s important to recognize that certain classes of ETFs are significantly riskier investments than others.\\n\\n Leveraged ETFs are a good example. These ETFs tend to experience value decay as time goes on and due to daily resets. This can happen even as an underlying index is thriving. Many analysts caution investors against buying leveraged ETFs at all. Investors who do take this approach should watch their investments carefully and mind the risks.\\n\\nSome ETFs are also inverse, in that they move in the opposite direction of their reference or benchmark. Leveraged inverse ETFs can return negative 2x or 3x the benchmark. Because of how they are structured, inverse ETFs decay in value over time.\\n Because they look similar on the page, ETFs and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are often confused with each other. However, investors should remember that these are very different investment vehicles. ETNs may also have a stated strategy, track an underlying index of commodities or stocks, and require fees, among other features.\\n\\n Nonetheless, ETNs tend to have a different set of risks from ETFs. ETNs face the risk of the solvency of an issuing company. If an issuing bank for an ETN defaults, or worse, declares bankruptcy, then investors are often out of luck. It’s a different risk from those associated with ETFs, and it’s something that investors eager to jump on board the ETF trend may not be aware of.\\n\\n An investor who buys shares in a pool of different individual stocks has more flexibility than one who buys the same group of stocks in an ETF. One way that this disadvantages the ETF investor is in their ability to control tax-loss harvesting. If the price of a stock goes down, an investor can sell shares at a loss, thereby reducing total capital gains and taxable income to a certain extent.\\n\\n Investors holding the same stock through an ETF don’t have the same luxury—the ETF determines when to adjust its portfolio, and the investor has to buy or sell an entire lot of stocks, rather than individual names.\\n\\n Like stocks, the price of an ETF can sometimes be different from that ETF’s underlying value. This can lead to situations in which an investor might actually pay a premium above and beyond the cost of the underlying stocks or commodities in an ETF portfolio just to buy that ETF. This is uncommon and is typically corrected over time, but it’s important to recognize as a risk that one takes when buying or selling an ETF.\\n\\n Check an ETF’s disparity against its net asset value (NAV) for irregularities. If it is consistently trading differently from its NAV in the market, something fishy may be going on.\\n\\n One of the same reasons why ETFs appeal to many investors also can be seen as a limitation of the industry. Investors typically do not have a say in the individual stocks in an ETF’s underlying index. This means that an investor looking to avoid a particular company or industry for a reason such as moral conflict does not have the same level of control as an investor focused on individual stocks.\\n\\n An ETF investor does not have to take the time to select the individual stocks making up the portfolio; on the other hand, the investor cannot exclude stocks without eliminating their investment in the entire ETF.\\n\\n While it’s not a flaw in the same sense as some of the previously mentioned items, investors should go into ETF investing with an accurate idea of what to expect from the performance.\\n\\n ETFs are most often linked to a benchmarking index, meaning that they are often not designed to outperform that index. Investors looking for this type of outperformance (which also, of course, carries added risks) should perhaps look to other opportunities.\\n\\nLiquidity is an important consideration in exchange-traded fund (ETF) investing. ETFs have differing liquidity profiles for many reasons. Investing in an ETF with relatively low liquidity may cost you in terms of a wider bid-ask spread, reduced opportunity to trade profitably, and—in extreme cases—an inability to withdraw funds in certain situations like a big market crash.\\nETFs are baskets of stocks or securities, but although this means that they are generally well diversified, some ETFs invest in very risky sectors or employ higher-risk strategies, such as leverage. For example, a leveraged ETF that tracks commodity prices may well be more volatile and hence riskier than a stable blue chip.\\nAn ETF’s tracking error is the difference between its returns and those of its underlying benchmark index. Tracking errors are generally small, and the largest, widely held ETFs have minimal tracking errors.\\nInverse and leveraged ETFs often use derivatives contracts like options and short-term forwards to achieve their stated goals. These types of instruments have inherent time decay, and they tend to lose value over time as a result, regardless of what happens in the index or benchmark that the ETF tracks. As a result, these products are only intended for day traders or others with very short holding periods.\\n Now that you know the risks that come with ETFs, you can make better investment decisions. ETFs have seen spectacular growth in popularity, and in many cases, this popularity is well deserved. But like all good things, ETFs also have their drawbacks.\\n\\n Making sound investment decisions requires knowing all of the facts about a particular investment vehicle, and ETFs are no different. Knowing the disadvantages will help steer you away from potential pitfalls and, if all goes well, toward tidy profits.\\n\\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Investment Products: Exchange-Traded Funds and Products.\"\\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Mutual Funds: About.\"\\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) – A Guide for Investors.\"\\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “Investor Bulletin: How To Read Confirmation Statements.” Page 3.\\nFidelity. \"Understanding Tracking Error and Tracking Difference for an ETF.\"\\nState Street Global Advisors. “ETF Liquidity: Master the Mechanics of ETF Trading.” Page 3.\\nCharles Schwab. “ETFs and Taxes: What You Need To Know.”\\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Volatility: The Pros and Cons of Dollar-Cost Averaging.\"\\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Exchange-Traded Funds and Products: The Lowdown on Leveraged and Inverse Exchange-Traded Products.\"\\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Exchange-Traded Notes—Avoid Unpleasant Surprises.\"\\nInternal Revenue Service. “Topic No 409 Capital Gains and Losses.”\\nFidelity. “Understanding Premiums and Discounts for ETFs.”\\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Updated Investor Bulletin: Leveraged and Inverse ETFs.\"'), ('Why Individual Small-Cap Stocks Can Outperform & Key Risks | TIKR.com', 'Individual small-cap stocks can oftentimes outperform their large-cap counterparts because small-cap companies tend to be able to grow faster while receiving less analyst coverage.\\nThis article covers when small-cap stocks tend to perform well, why they can be good investments, and what investors should consider before adding them to a portfolio.\\nTable of Contents:\\nLet’s dive in!\\nLarge companies struggle to grow as quickly as small companies because they already dominate their industries.\\nSmall-cap stocks, on the other hand, start with lower revenue, which makes it easier for them to double or triple sales in a short time.\\nFor example, The Trade Desk (TTD) had under $100 million in annual revenue when it went public in 2016.\\nAs digital advertising spending soared, the company expanded rapidly, pushing its stock price up more than 40x.\\nWall Street analysts focus more on large-cap stocks, which leaves many small-cap companies underfollowed. This lack of coverage creates opportunities for investors who do deep research.\\nExample: In the early 2000s, Trex (TREX) dominated the composite decking market but received little analyst attention.\\nAs demand for low-maintenance decking surged, Trex grew into a multi-billion-dollar company, which was very rewarding for its early investors.\\nSmall-cap companies often operate in emerging industries or create disruptive products.\\nThey move faster than larger competitors, allowing them to capture market share before established businesses react.\\nFor instance, Upstart (UPST) used artificial intelligence to improve credit underwriting.\\nThe company’s ability to innovate quickly helped it grow revenue rapidly, though macroeconomic challenges later impacted its stock price.\\nLarge companies frequently buy small-cap stocks to expand their product offerings or enter new markets. Investors who buy small-caps with strong acquisition appeal can benefit when a larger company offers to acquire the smaller company at a premium price for the stock.\\nFor example, Salesforce (CRM) acquired Slack (previously $WORK) in 2021 for $27.7 billion, at a premium price to what Slack stock was trading at before the acquisition.\\nSlack had positioned itself as a key player in workplace communication, and its acquisition premium rewarded shareholders who recognized its long-term potential.\\nSmall-cap stocks often trade at lower earnings and revenue multiples than large-cap stocks for several reasons:\\nMany small-cap stocks have low institutional ownership, leading to less buying pressure. As companies grow and attract large investors, their stock prices often rise.\\nFor instance, Cloudflare (NET) had low institutional ownership early on. As hedge funds and mutual funds recognized its growth potential, more capital flowed into the company, which pushed the stock higher.\\nBy understanding the valuation gap between small-caps and large-caps, investors can identify stocks with room to re-rate at a higher multiple as they grow.\\nSmall-cap stocks go through cycles of outperformance and underperformance. Investors who recognize these patterns can adjust their strategies to maximize returns.\\nSmall-cap stocks perform well in certain market conditions, including:\\nExample: From 2009 to 2013, the Russell 2000 Index outperformed the S&P 500 as the economy recovered from the financial crisis.\\nLower interest rates and improving corporate earnings fueled small-cap gains.\\nAdditional Example: After the Fed cut rates in 2020, small-caps had a historic rally, with the Russell 2000 surging over 100% from its pandemic low.\\nSmall-caps are less likely to outperform during tough market conditions:\\nFor example, in 2022, as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively, small-cap stocks lagged large-caps. Investors rotated into more stable, cash-flow-generating businesses, leaving riskier small stocks behind.\\nWhile small-cap stocks can deliver strong returns, they also come with additional risks that investors must consider.\\nSmall-cap stocks often have low trading volume, leading to:\\nFor example, micro-cap biotech stocks often experience extreme volatility, rising or falling 50%+ in a single trading session based on news or earnings reports.\\nSmall businesses tend to be more vulnerable to economic downturns than large corporations. Investors should watch for:\\nFor example, during the 2008 financial crisis, many small banks and retailers collapsed, while large corporations with diversified revenue streams weathered the storm better.\\nMany small-cap stocks rely on a single customer or supplier for a large portion of revenue.\\nLosing that relationship can cause serious financial trouble.\\nFor example, GoPro (GPRO) depended heavily on Best Buy (BBY) and Amazon (AMZN) for distribution, making it vulnerable to shifts in retail demand.\\nAs sales growth slowed and competition increased, the company struggled to diversify revenue, contributing to a steep stock decline.\\nHistorically, small caps have outperformed large caps over long periods.\\nBut, small-caps also carry higher risks. Their volatility, lower liquidity, and sensitivity to macroeconomic trends mean investors need a strategy that accounts for both upside potential and downside protection.\\nUltimately, every investor’s situation is different, from risk tolerance to time horizon and financial goals. It’s up to each person to choose investments that fit their strategy.\\nInvestors should consider small-caps alongside other asset classes to balance risk and return. Small-cap exposure works well when combined with:\\nFor example, an investor who held both small-cap growth stocks and dividend-paying large-caps in the 2010s saw strong returns with lower volatility than an all-small-cap portfolio.\\nSmall-cap investing rewards patience. Many of the best small-cap stocks take years to realize their full potential.\\nInvestors who focus on long-term trends, strong fundamentals, and proven management teams often achieve better results than those trying to trade short-term price swings.\\nFor instance, MercadoLibre (MELI) spent years expanding in Latin America before becoming an e-commerce giant. Investors who stayed patient instead of selling on early volatility saw exponential gains.\\nBy understanding when small-caps perform best, managing risk effectively, and thinking long-term, investors can use small-cap stocks to enhance portfolio returns while minimizing downside exposure.\\nSmall-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks because they have higher growth potential, face less analyst coverage, and often operate in underpenetrated markets. These factors create opportunities for investors to find undervalued companies before they gain widespread attention.\\nSmall-cap stocks underperform during recessions, periods of high inflation, and when interest rates rise, making borrowing more expensive. In these environments, investors often shift capital toward large-cap stocks with stronger balance sheets.\\nSmall-cap stocks carry more risk than large-cap stocks due to lower liquidity, higher volatility, and greater sensitivity to economic conditions. However, investors who manage risk well can still achieve strong long-term returns.\\nInterest rates affect small-cap stocks because rising rates increase borrowing costs and reduce liquidity in the market, making investors more risk-averse. Conversely, falling rates often boost small-cap performance by improving access to capital and encouraging economic growth.\\nThe best time to buy small-cap stocks is early in an economic recovery, after a major market sell-off, or when interest rates peak and start to decline.

He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\\nA small-cap stock is a company with a market capitalization between $250 million to $2 billion. The precise figures used can vary among different brokerages, so this is a guide to their classification.\\n A small-cap stock is a stock from a public company whose total market value, or market capitalization, is about $250 million to $2 billion. The precise figures vary. Small-cap stock investors are generally looking for up-and-coming young companies that are growing fast. That is, they\\'re looking for the large-cap stocks of the future.\\n\\n The \"cap\" in small-cap stands for capitalization. The term in its entirety is market capitalization.\\n\\n This is the market\\'s current estimate of the total dollar value of a company\\'s\\xa0outstanding shares. To calculate a company\\'s market capitalization, multiply its current share price by the number of outstanding shares.\\n\\n Classifications such as \"large-cap\" or \"small-cap\" are approximations that change over time. Furthermore, the precise definition of small-cap stocks versus large-cap stocks may vary among brokers.\\n\\n One misconception about small-cap stocks is that they are\\xa0startups\\xa0or brand new companies. In reality, many small-cap stocks are of companies that are well-established businesses with strong track records and great financials. And because they are smaller, small-cap stock share prices have a greater chance of growth.\\n\\n As a rule, small-cap stock companies offer investors more room for growth but also bring greater risk and volatility than large-cap stock companies.\\n\\n A large-cap offering has a market capitalization of $10 billion or higher. For large-cap stock companies such as General Electric (GE) and Coca-Cola Co. (KO), aggressive growth may be in the rear-view mirror. Such companies offer investors stability and dividends but rarely fast growth.\\n\\n That said, whether smaller or larger companies perform better over time varies on many factors.\\n\\n For example, large-cap stock companies dominated during the tech bubble of the 1990s, as investors gravitated toward stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO), and AOL Time Warner. After the bubble burst in March 2000, small-cap stock companies became the better performers, as many of the large caps hemorrhaged value in the crash.\\n\\n One advantage of\\xa0investing\\xa0in small-cap stocks is the opportunity to beat\\xa0institutional investors. Many mutual funds have internal rules that restrict them from buying small-cap stock companies. In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940 prohibits mutual funds from owning more than 10% of a company\\'s voting stock. This makes it difficult for mutual funds to build a meaningful position in small-cap stocks.\\n\\nA stock smaller than a small-cap is known as a micro-cap. That is a publicly traded company with a market\\xa0capitalization of less than $250 million.\\n Investors who want the best of both worlds might consider mid-cap stocks, which have market capitalizations between $2 billion and $10 billion. Historically, these companies can offer more stability than small-cap stock companies yet confer more growth potential than large-cap stock companies.\\n\\n However, for self-directed investors, spending the time to sift through small caps to find a diamond in the rough can prove to be time well spent. Even in our data-rich world, great small-cap investments fly under investors\\' radars because they get little coverage from analysts.\\n\\n Shares in both small-cap stocks and penny stocks have lower market value than large- or mid-cap stocks. Penny stocks have small market capitalizations, so they could be considered small-cap stocks. However, there are specific characteristics that make a stock a penny stock, which not all small-cap stocks share.\\n\\n Penny stocks have share prices lower than $5. Some are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Most, though, are traded directly (known as over-the-counter or through \"pink sheets\") rather than through a stock exchange.\\n\\n Penny stocks are considered high-risk investments due to their:\\n\\n Unlike a penny stock, small-cap stocks can have a share price of $5 and higher.

Their stock can be purchased through a brokerage account. Before investing in a company, you\\'ll want to investigate its:\\n\\n If researching individual small-cap stocks is too time-consuming or seems too risky, you can also buy small-cap mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These might track broad small-cap indexes, specific industries within the small-cap market, or investment goals like value or growth.\\n\\n Many brokerages offer small-cap stock index funds, either as mutual funds or as ETFs, to track the U.S. small-cap market. Depending on the brokerage you use, you could, for example, invest in the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund (VSMX) or the Fidelity Small Cap Index Fund (FSSNX).\\n\\n However, there are two main small-cap indexes that are used as benchmarks for the small-cap equities market.\\n\\n The Russell 2000 is a small-cap stock market index composed of the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. The index is frequently used as a benchmark for measuring the performance of small-cap stock mutual funds. It is managed by London\\'s\\xa0FTSE Russell Group.\\n\\n Because it tracks such a broad share of the small-cap market, the Russell 2000 is used by many mutual funds and ETFs. It is heavily weighted by financials, industrials, and healthcare. \\xa0\\n\\n The S&P SmallCap 600 Index was established by Standard & Poor\\'s (the creator of the S&P 500). It uses a capitalization-weighted index to broadly track the performance of small-cap stocks on the U.S. equities market. It includes 600 companies and represents close to 3% of the U.S. market.\\n\\n Unlike many other small-cap benchmarks, the S&P 600 has an earnings requirement, which is used to ensure the quality of the stocks included and hedge against volatility. To be included, a company must have a market capitalization between $1 billion and $6.7 billion.\\n\\n It must also:\\n\\nSmall-cap stocks can be a good investment. They typically have the potential for growth, much larger than large-cap stocks/blue chip companies, so if an investor gets in at a good price, they may see a good return. Small-cap stocks are more risky and volatile than the stocks of larger, more established companies, so investors must take extra care in their analysis before making any investment decisions.\\nWhether small-cap stocks or mid-cap stocks are better depends on the specific company. Any company with good fundamentals, a strong business strategy, smart leadership, and a competitive edge, can be a good investment, whether they are a small- or mid-sized company. Small-cap stocks have more growth potential than mid-cap stocks, so investors may see a better return; however, small-cap stocks are also more risky and volatile than mid-cap stocks, so the loss potential is greater.\\nYes, small-cap stocks can be good for the long term. If you can invest in a small-cap stock that has good fundamentals and an overall healthy analysis, the stock will most likely grow over the long term. If you can invest before a bull run on the market and hold the stock for the long term, then you could see a strong financial return.\\n Small-cap stocks are the stocks of companies whose market capitalization is roughly between $250 million and $2 billion. These companies are attractive investment opportunities for investors as they have the potential for significant growth with the possibility of becoming large-cap stock companies.\\n\\n Because there is more upside than a large-cap stock, investors do take on more risk; but on the bright side, small-cap stocks have better opportunities for larger growth. Investors should carefully evaluate companies with a smaller market cap to determine if there is growth potential before making any investment decision in the hopes of a future windfall.\\n\\nFINRA. \"Market Cap Explained.\"\\nLong Term Trends. \"Large-Cap vs. Small-Cap Stocks.\"\\nLibrary of Congress. \"Investment Company Act of 1940.\"\\nFINRA. \"SEC Adoption of Penny-Stock Disclosure Rules Under the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990.\"\\nFTSE Russell. \"Russell 2000 Factsheet,\" Page 2.\\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"S&P U.S. Indices Methodology,\" Page 27.\\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"S&P Small Cap 600,\" Page 2.'), ('The outlook for US small caps in 2025', 'The sustainable investor for a changing world\\nThe outlook for US small-capitalisation stocks is better now than it has been for several years. The main reasons include the US interest rate cutting cycle (small caps tend to benefit), currently attractive valuations, the reshoring trend, and (expected) merger & acquisition activity, argue Geoff Dailey, Chris Fay, and Vincent Nichols. \\xa0\\nThe US Federal Reserve began its dovish pivot in September 2024 and continued loosening monetary policy in November and December. As shown in Exhibit 1, the performance of small-cap stocks is correlated with changes in policy rate expectations: When market expectations for the course of the Fed’s policy rate turn more dovish, small caps tend to outperform.\\nThis phenomenon is likely a function of the cost of debt falling for small-cap companies which typically have a higher proportion of variable rate debt than larger-cap companies. Declining policy rates should also encourage merger & acquisition (M&A) activity as 2025 gets underway.\\nMore recently, longer-term interest rates have risen. This is due to market expectations of higher economic growth in the wake of Donald Trump’s election as US president, expectations for higher inflation, and concerns over the impact of tax cuts on an already bulging US budget deficit. The Fed now also looks to have become more hawkish about the outlook for inflation.\\nWhile higher interest rates can be a drag on equities, they mostly reflect a strong economy. Combined with the boost to revenue growth from somewhat higher inflation, we believe higher profits should more than offset the higher cost of debt servicing for smaller companies.\\nPrice/earnings ratios for small-cap stocks have recovered from the lows and are now trading slightly above their long-run average of 16.7 times (excluding companies with negative earnings). However, relative to large-cap indices, small-cap P/E multiples look low, at currently more than 30% below average (see Exhibit 2).\\n\\nWe expect earnings to drive the next leg higher for small-cap shares. Analysts are looking for robust earnings growth: by 42% in 2025 and by 36% in 2026 compared to just 6% in 2024 (see Exhibit 3). That is ahead of the historical earnings growth rate of 15%.\\nWhile generally speaking, earnings forecasts are often optimistic, we believe that with a soft or no landing ahead for the US economy, they are not wildly off the mark. If the higher earnings growth rates are realised, valuations should improve.\\nFour big tech companies (Amazon, Google, Meta and Nvidia1) generated the bulk of earnings growth in the US market in 2024. This contributed to the outperformance of the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100, the small-cap Russell 1000 Growth and, to a lesser degree, the broad S&P500.\\nEarnings for the ‘big four’ grew by 70% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, compared to just 6% for the remaining 496 companies in the S&P500. That gap is forecast to narrow (see Exhibit 4) and consequently so should the gap in stock market performance between the different indices.\\n1 Mentioned for illustrative purposes only. This is not a recommendation to buy or sell securities. BNP Paribas Asset Management may or may not hold positions in these stocks.\\nFor decades after China’s admission to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001, US companies focused on outsourcing production to lower-cost nations (such as China) to improve profits. Industrial production stagnated in the US, while it rose sharply in China.\\nWe see potential for that trend to reverse in the coming years. During the pandemic, having supply chains and manufacturing far from home created widespread difficulties for US firms and many are now looking to ‘re-shore’ production.\\nRising geopolitical tensions and protectionism are other catalysts, backed by financial support from the US federal government’s CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\\nWe believe re-shoring initiatives will drive a cycle of capital expenditure for many years ahead. US small caps should benefit as they are more levered to domestic investment and economic trends.\\nInformation technology spending on datacentres – key to the infrastructure supporting the artificial intelligence (AI) ‘arms race’ – is boosting not only sales of advanced graphic processing units (GPUs), but also revenues at many lesser-known hardware, software, industrial, materials and even utility companies.\\nThis spending is funded largely by the profits of other tech companies that are investing to grow their business, rather than hoarding cash or boosting earnings per share (EPS) via share buybacks.\\nM&A is another potential tailwind for small caps. As optimism over the outlook for the economy rises and political uncertainty fades, deal flow should improve. Strategic buyers are always evaluating opportunities for innovation or disruption and may now move towards implementation.\\nWe see several tailwinds for smaller US companies emerging with monetary policy less restrictive, as earnings recover, and valuation dislocations normalise.\\nThese market inflections could be supported further by trends in onshoring and re-shoring, and a resumption of M&A activity.\\nTo us, the future looks brighter for small-cap stocks than it has in some time.\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMarket gyrations due to rapidly changing tariffs are likely to continue until some sort of agreement is reached between the...\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the ‘Liberation Day’ turmoil, US President Donald Trump last week adjusted his ‘reciprocal’ tariffs, reviving risk-on trades, with US...\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSubscribe to receive this week’s articles straight to your inbox.\\nThe sustainable investor for a changing world'), ('About Treasury Marketable Securities â\\x80\\x94 TreasuryDirect', 'The federal government finances its operation in part by selling various types of securities.

However, it also carries notable risks, such as complexity and the potential for significant losses.\\nIn this article, we will examine the benefits and risks of options trading which are taught in many option trading classes so that you can see how they fit into your overall trading plan.\\nOptions trading gives traders flexibility, potential for profits, and risk management capabilities. Below are some advantages:\\nIf you opt for options trading, you can have control of many assets by investing a small amount. For instance, instead of purchasing 100 shares of a stock, you could purchase one call option contract that represents these 100 shares at a fraction of the cost.\\nThrough this leverage, profits may be increased if the trade is successful. However, you should remember that leverage can also multiply losses if this trade does not work out well. So it is better to be careful.\\nOptions allow traders to manage risk by hedging against potential losses in their portfolios. For example, purchasing put options on a stock can act as an insurance policy against the decline of its trades, by paying money for the option, limiting their downside risk irrespective of how low the price of the stock may go.\\nThis defensive tactic gives some protection that enables traders to reduce losses in unpredictable market environments.\\nSelling options contracts generates income through premiums, particularly in low-volatility markets. By taking on the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price (strike price), traders collect upfront payments.\\nThis strategy, known as option writing, offers a steady income stream. However, it requires careful risk management to avoid potential losses if the market moves unfavorably.\\nOverall, it provides an opportunity to profit from the passage of time and stable market conditions.\\nThere’s no doubt that options trading can be worthwhile, yet it is related to important risks as well. Here are a few significant dangers involved in options trading.\\nOptions have expiry dates, which means they last just for a period. In case of failure to move in the anticipated direction within that time frame, the option may be worthless on its expiry date. This leads to losing the premium amount paid for it.\\nUnlike stocks, where you can hold onto them indefinitely, options have a limited lifespan, making it crucial to time your trades accurately to avoid losing your investment.\\nVolatility risk in options trading refers to how the price of an option can change due to fluctuations in the underlying asset’s volatility.\\nHigher volatility typically leads to higher option prices, but if volatility decreases, option values may decline, causing losses.\\nEssentially, unexpected changes in market volatility can impact option prices, making it crucial for traders to consider and manage this risk when making trading decisions.\\nWhen you buy options, the most you can lose is the money you paid for them. But if you sell options, especially without owning the underlying asset, your potential losses could be unlimited.\\nThis means that if the market moves against your position, you could lose more money than you initially invested.\\nSo, while buying options limits your risk, selling them without proper protection can expose you to significant financial danger.\\nOptions trading offers chances for higher returns but also comes with risks. By learning about the pros and cons we discussed, you’re better prepared for this type of investing. It’s important to keep learning and managing risks wisely.

They are not marketable because each is registered to one person\\'s social security number. You cannot sell them or transfer them to someone else.\\n\\nTreasury Bills are short-term securities with five term options, from 4 weeks up to 52 weeks. Bills are sold at face value or at a discount from the face value. When they mature, you\\'re paid the face value. \\n\\nTreasury Notes are government securities which are issued with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years. Notes pay interest every six months.\\n\\nTreasury Bonds (different from U.S. Savings Bonds) pay interest every six months. Historically a 30-year investment, Treasury Bonds are now offered in 20-year terms, as well.\\n\\nInterest payments on an FRN rise and fall based on the discount rates for 13-week Treasury bills. FRNs are only issued for a term of two years and pay interest quarterly (every three months).\\n\\nTIPS are Treasury marketable securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the Consumer Price Index. TIPS pay interest every six months and are issued in terms of 5, 10, and 30 years.\\n\\nSTRIPS let investors hold and trade the individual interest and principal components of eligible Treasury Notes, Bonds, and TIPS separately.

Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master\\'s in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\\n Gold has captivated human kind for millennia-serving not only as a symbol of wealth but as a cornerstone of the global financial system.\\n\\n Understanding what drives gold prices is crucial for investors, economists, and anyone interested in the value of this precious metal. This guide explores the factors that drive its price.\\n\\n Gold\\'s distinctive characteristics set it apart from other investments. Beyond its luster, the metal\\'s limited supply and indestructible nature have contributed to its stability as a long-term store of value. Gold cannot be printed like currency or created out of thin air. Its scarcity and permanence have made it a hedge against currency devaluation or inflation and economic instability.\\n\\n Unlike stocks or bonds, gold is tangible. It maintains high liquidity across global markets and is universally recognized as valuable, regardless of political or economic conditions. Its value tends to rise when confidence in other financial assets declines, particularly during periods of high inflation, economic uncertainty, or geopolitical instability.\\n\\n These properties make it an attractive part of diversified investment portfolios.\\n\\n The modern era of gold pricing effectively began in 1971 with the end of the Bretton Woods system, which had previously fixed gold\\'s price to the U.S. dollar. Gold prices have been allowed to float freely, leading to significant volatility throughout the 1970s as stagflation drove investors toward safe havens. The decade culminated in January 1980 with gold reaching what remains its inflation-adjusted peak of about $3,300 in today\\'s dollars. The metal would then enter a lengthy decline through the 1980s and 1990s, bottoming at just $253 per ounce in 1999 amid a strong global economy.\\n\\n The 21st century ushered in a new chapter for gold prices, marked by several dramatic rallies tied to major economic crises. The 2008 financial crisis saw gold surge from $730 to $1,300 between October 2008 and October 2010, while the European sovereign debt crisis pushed prices to $1,825 by mid-2011. More recently, the pandemic triggered another significant rally. High inflation kept that rally going, and political instability kept the trend going once inflation pulled back from the highs in early 2020. Gold ultimately reached a new nominal record high above $2,900 in February 2025.\\n\\n When viewing gold\\'s performance in a broader context, however, it\\'s important to take a comparative approach. If you invested $100 in gold in 1972, that would have grown to about $4,500 by 2024, an impressive return, until you compared investing the same $100 invested in the S&P 500, which would have grown to over $18,500. The chart below compares the annual returns for gold and the S&P 500 over time:\\n\\n This historical perspective reveals gold\\'s dual nature: while it serves as a useful hedge during specific conditions like high inflation or market uncertainty, it may underperform other assets during periods of stability and growth.\\n\\n As with any produced commodity, the law of supply and demand fundamentally drives the price of gold. Yet, gold is fairly unique because new supply each year is small compared with the total existing stock, making prices particularly sensitive to fluctuations in demand or sentiment rather than production levels.\\n\\n Annual mine production adds approximately about 2% to 3% to the above-ground gold stock. However, changes in production levels, whether due to discoveries, technological advances, or regulatory constraints, still influence prices. For example, environmental regulations and increasing extraction costs have made new mining projects more challenging, potentially constraining future supply growth.\\n\\nMajor gold producing countries include China, South Africa, the United States, Australia, Russia, Ghana, Indonesia, and Peru.\\n Central banks influence gold prices through their reserve management policies. They hold about one-fifth of all gold ever mined.\\n\\n Central banks buy gold to maintain stability and credibility in their monetary systems and preserve national wealth against various economic risks-and when they do make large purchases, their actions can drive up global gold prices by both reducing available supply and signaling confidence in gold as a strategic asset.\\n\\n In recent years, there has been an increase in gold purchases by central banks, particularly from emerging market economies seeking to diversify their reserves away from the U.S. dollar.\\n\\n Since gold is often dollar-denominated on world markets, its price tends to exhibit an inverse relationship with the U.S. dollar.\\n\\n Gold is comparatively less expensive for foreign buyers when the dollar weakens against other major currencies, potentially increasing demand and driving up prices. Conversely, a stronger dollar often corresponds with lower gold prices.\\n\\n Relatedly, when U.S. interest rates are low, the opportunity cost of holding gold (which pays no yield) decreases, making it more attractive to investors. When interest rates rise, gold demand may fall.\\xa0This relationship becomes particularly important during periods of high inflation. If rates lag behind inflation, creating negative real interest rates, gold often benefits as investors seek to preserve purchasing power.\\n\\n That said, in the mid-2020s, gold prices continued to rise even as interest rates and inflation have come down.\\n\\n Market volatility, geopolitical tensions, and economic crises often drive investors toward gold as a safe haven asset. During periods of uncertainty, gold\\'s historical stability and lack of correlation with other financial assets make it particularly attractive.\\n\\n In this way, gold has often served as a sort of insurance against extreme market events and systemic risks that could impact traditional investment portfolios. Gold\\'s physical nature and its 5,000-year history as a store of value make it uniquely suited to satisfy this deeply rooted human instinct for security during turbulent times. This psychological anchor helps explain why gold often experiences increased demand precisely when other assets are sold in a panic, creating characteristic countercyclical price movements.\\n\\n Investment demand for gold through specialized mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other investment vehicles has emerged as a major force in the gold market since the early 2000s, fundamentally changing how both institutional and retail investors access gold. These financial products allow investors to gain exposure to gold prices without the logistical challenges of storing and securing actual bullion, effectively democratizing gold investment.\\n\\n When investors buy shares in gold ETFs, the funds typically purchase and store physical gold to back up these shares, creating a direct link between fund flows and physical gold demand.\\n\\n As of the first quarter of 2025, SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), one of the largest gold ETFs, along with its lower-cost sister fund GLDM, collectively held more than 31.6 million ounces of gold—worth more than $90 billion.\\n\\n The jewelry sector traditionally dominates gold demand, accounting for approximately 50% of annual consumption. This demand is deeply rooted in cultural traditions and economic behavior, which is particularly evident in markets like India and China, where gold jewelry serves a dual purpose as both fashion/adornment and as a store of wealth. The cultural significance of gold in these markets creates distinct demand patterns, such as predictable spikes during wedding seasons in India or Chinese New Year celebrations.\\n\\n While industrial applications consume smaller quantities of gold, they represent an increasingly significant and more stable source of demand, primarily due to gold\\'s unique physical properties that make it difficult to substitute in critical applications. The electronics industry uses gold for its superior electrical conductivity and resistance to corrosion, making it important in manufacturing sophisticated devices, from smartphones to medical equipment.\\n\\n Gold also sees demand from ETFs. These are securities that hold the metal and issue shares that investors can buy and sell, just like stocks. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF is the largest and it held about 863 tons of gold in September 2024.\\n\\n When expected or actual returns on bonds, equities, and real estate fall, the interest in gold investing can increase, driving up its price. Gold can be used as a hedge to protect against economic events like currency devaluation or inflation.\\n\\nWhile some ETFs represent ownership in the actual metal, others hold shares of mining companies rather than actual gold.\\n Gold prices are determined by a range of factors, from central bank policies to industrial demand and investor sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone considering gold as an investment or seeking to comprehend its role in the global financial system.\\n\\nWorld Gold Council. \"Correlation.\"\\nTrading Economics. \"Gold.\"\\nAswath Damodaran. \"Historical Returns on Stocks, Bonds and Bills: 1928-2023.\"\\nOfficial Data. \"S&P 500 Data.\"\\nThe Perth Mint. \"The gold market structure and size.\"\\nTole, L., & Koop, G.

Gold and silver are discovered by mining companies, removed from the earth as ore, and then extracted from the ore using chemicals or extreme heat.\\n\\n Bullion is commonly kept as a reserve asset by governments and central banks. Investors can purchase precious metals in physical bullion or paper form or hold shares in exchange-traded funds(ETFs) or futures contracts.\\n\\n Gold bullion can be considered legal tender, held in reserves by central banks, or used by institutional investors to hedge against inflationary effects on their portfolios. Central banks use gold to settle international debt or stimulate economies by lending bullion reserves to bullion banks as part of the precious metals market.\\n\\n Some activities include clearing, risk management, hedging, trading, vaulting, and acting as intermediaries between lenders and borrowers. Nearly all bullion banks are members of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), an over-the-counter (OTC) market. The eleven LBMA market makers include:\\n\\n When a central bank lends gold to bullion banks, it receives the cash equivalent of the gold. The central bank lends this money on the market at a lease rate known as the Gold Forward Offered Rate (GOFO), published daily by the LBMA. The higher the lease rate, the more incentive a central bank has to lend gold from its reserves.\\n\\n If the bullion bank sells the gold on the spot market, it will receive cash for the transaction. The spot market is where bullion and other commodities are traded at the prevailing market rate. Bullion banks that lend gold to mining companies usually do so to finance a project run by the company.\\n\\n A mining firm may borrow gold if it enters into a forward hedge contract in which gold that has not yet been mined or extracted is pre-sold to buyers. If some or all of its buyers expect a physical delivery of the gold bullion, the mining firm may borrow the gold from the bank, which would subsequently be delivered to the buyers on the other end of the forward agreement.\\n\\nPrecious metals historically played a central role in the global economy because many currencies were backed by them, as in the case of the\\xa0gold standard, which ended in 1971.\\n\\n Bullion is traded in the bullion market, which is primarily an OTC market open 24 hours a day. Trade volume in the bullion market is high since it includes the vast majority of bullion trading prices throughout a given day. Most transactions are completed electronically or by phone. There are various bullion markets globally, including London, New York, Tokyo, and Zurich.\\xa0\\n\\n The price of gold bullion is influenced by demand from companies that use gold to make jewelry, electronics parts, and other products. Gold is a popular investment during times of economic instability. Although gold tends to have greater demand, both gold and silver bullion are viewed by many investors as safe-haven investments.\\n\\n Rising prices or inflation in an economy erode the return on investments. If an investor, for example, earned 4% on a bond and prices rose by 2%, the return on the bond investment was only 2% in real terms. If overall prices are rising, commodities tend to increase. As a result, gold and silver bullion are used to hedge investment portfolios against inflation.\\n\\nIn 1933, Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102, making it illegal to own gold bullion and coins. This order is no longer in effect, and you can own gold in most jurisdictions.\\nBullion is the term for gold or silver in bar or ingot form that is 99.5% pure or higher.\\nBouillon (pronounced bool-yon) is a broth, while bullion (pronounced bull-yen) is bricks of precious metals with purities of more than 99.5%.\\n Bullion is the physical form of gold and silver held as bars, ingots, or coins. It is commonly held as reserves by central banks. In the United States, gold is held by the U.S. Mint at Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Silver is purchased in different forms including silver coins, bars, jewellery, idols, and utensils, among other items. Before investing in silver, it is important to know the current silver rate and further keep track of the market conditions. Apart from the market condition, one must also know about the factors concerning the purity of the silver, the authenticity of the seller, and the standards for determining weight. If you’re planning to invest in silver, here's what you need to know.\\nAs per the latest numbers, the silver rate in India stands at Rs 70.9 per gram and Rs 70,900 per kg. The prices are updated every day, at par with industry standards.\\nLike gold prices, silver prices in India are also affected by a number of factors like demand, global market movement, political factors, and government policies.\\nDemand: During festive and wedding seasons, the demand for purchasing precious metals like gold and silver rises significantly, thus leaving a major impact on their prices.\\nGlobal market: While silver is considered to be a safer option for investors due to its less volatility, the global market movement also affects the price of silver in India. A drop in oil prices and the dollar usually causes a rise in silver prices. For example, if Rupee falls against the Dollar and the international prices are stable, silver is expected to become costlier inIndia.\\nPolitical factors and government policies: Global political factors and a number of government policies also affect silver prices in India as any kind of change leads to a global impact, thus playing a role in silver prices.\\nSilver rates: On the basis of international market prices, silver rates also change on a regular basis. This is why it is important to keep track of silver prices to buy them at the best rates.\\nMaking charges: Just like gold, jewellers may levy making charges on silver jewellery or cutlery. Therefore, it is important to ask directly about the applied making charges to the jewellers.\\nSellers: People need to research the sellers before purchasing silver to ensure that they buy genuine products with verified purity. This will not only provide them with good quality silver but will also help them to get the best resale value of silver.\\nCertification: While buying silver, it is important to check the certification of the jewellery or the other items.\\nIs investing in silver a bad or good idea?While the cost of silver is far lesser than gold in India, it is still a safe option for investment. Reselling silver jewellery, cutlery, coins, or bars will help get better returns, based on the current market prices.\\nHow to Differentiate Between Pure Silver and Sterling Silver?Fine silver is 99.9% pure silver and is soft in comparison to sterling silver. Sterling on the other hand is an alloy that is made mostly of silver and includes a small percentage of copper and zinc to strengthen it. While both of these look almost the same, silver is not very durable due to softness and sterling silver can last a lifetime if properly cared for. On the other hand, sterling silver is more easily tarnished than pure silver, because of the other metals in it.\\nTODAY Gold Rate Per Gram\\nGlobal market fluctuations and inappropriate or unstable demand and supply ratios can lead to an increase in silver rates, thus impacting silver prices in India.\\nIn comparison to silver jewellery, silver coins or bars are significantly heavier and more durable. Thus, buying silver coins or bars can assure a better return and resale value.\\nOne can purchase silver bars from banks, certified jewellers, and online agents in India. Customers need to note that banks usually charge higher rates, in comparison to jewellery shops because of the purity checks and assurance that they provide.\\nHallmarking is essential for ensuring the purity of the silver that you are purchasing. It is used as a seal of purity.\\nConsidered a purity indicator, while hallmarking is not yet mandatory for silver, getting it done will help ensure that your purchase meets certain quality standards.\\nThe best time to buy silver is during festive or wedding seasons, as jewellers often provide exciting offers and discounts on purchases.\\nVAT and GST are usually charged on both the purchase and sale of silver in India.\\nWhile there are no such regulations over the limit of owning silver in India, the government does charge certain taxes after a certain purchase limit is crossed.\\nIndia is among the world’s biggest silver importers. According to a government statement, India imported nearly 245 billion Indian rupees worth of silver in FY 2022.\\nPeople can opt for a number of ways to invest in silver in India. From purchasing silver jewellery to buying silver coins, and bars, and investing in the Commodity Futures Exchange, there are a lot of options. While silver jewellery is usually purchased for personal use, investments in coins and bars are often by banks and institutions for official purposes. Similarly, professional investors opt for investment in the Commodity Futures Exchange, while keeping an eye on the market.\\nMoneycontrol makes no guarantee or warranty on the accuracy of the data provided on this site, the prevailing rates are susceptible to change with Market value and provided on an as-is basis.
